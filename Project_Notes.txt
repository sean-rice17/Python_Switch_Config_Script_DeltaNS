    There are 3 file locations available to users:

    /usr/local/cfg
        Default Working Directory
        Configuration and policy files are generally stored here
    /usr/local/tmp
        Directory for temporary or debug files
        This directory's contents persists through reboots, but system generated files may be overwritten or altered automatically
    /usr/local/ext
        USB Mount Point
        Contains the files of any inserted FAT/FAT32 formatted USB

Filter all devices by OUI, excluding all uplink ports
loop through all devices and configure them automatically
ask the user to run again with new OUI, vlan, and uplink ports
repeat until finished
